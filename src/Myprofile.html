          My passion for technology, especially in the field of Computer
          Programming started becoming consuming and a knock on my consciousness
          to become awake to my potential in this field.
          <br />I was highly motivated by my passion for problem solving, as it
          become more glaring that technology is the leading tool in solving
          emerging humanity challenges in this era and era to come.
